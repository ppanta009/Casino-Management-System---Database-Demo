STEP 1

-->To run the first three cypher query resembling the first assignment

-Import all the .csv file 
-Please run the import1.cypher file first and then run the first three code in query.cypher

STEP 2

-->To run the rest of the cypher queries of query.cypher file (except first three already ran queries) 

Please run import2.cypher file in same database after running the first three query 
Then please run the remaining queries of query.cypher

Modifications made in tables:

-->USER entity type has been removed 
-->All the entities of USER have been distributed in CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE table accordingly
-->Some nodes have been added to demonstrate the use of neo4j functions and graph similairity algo.

NOTE: If you import1.cypher and import2.cypher then run all the queries from cypher.query you will get
different result for the first three queries but all the other queries will show the same result, So please first 
perform STEP 1 and then STEP 2.
